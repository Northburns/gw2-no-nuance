 TODO:
 - setup list of item ids we're interested in (all tradeable?)
 - for each: download the "weeks worth of data with hourly intervals" from https://gitlab.com/Silvers_Gw2/Market_Data_Processer/-/wikis/endpoints
 - feel free to overwrite previous: we're only interested in the last week.

 Does that service include "volume" metrics? 

 - DO NUMBER CRUNCHING!
