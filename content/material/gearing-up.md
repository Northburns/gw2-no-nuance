I heard you want to gear up a character? Read on!

## Preface

Just so we're clear: If your character is not yet level 80, don't waste gold nor time on gearing your character. You'll replace all sub-80 gear anyways.

First and foremost: **Exotic gear is fine!** For nearly all content, it will serve you well. You _need_ Ascended gear for Tier 4 fractals (for agony infusions), and some raid groups require you to have Ascended gear for that extra edge. Exotic gear is soul bound, and Ascended is account bound, so that's nice too, of course.

What stat-lines to pick? Read up on builds from your favorite build website.

Good resources:

* [Tanetris' "So You Want To Gear a Character"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character). It's very good!
* [Dak393's "New player guide/Gearing"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide/Gearing)
* [Wiki's Equipment query](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:RunQuery/Equipment_query). It is a pretty neat way to search for equippable gear!
* [Armor Sets filter table](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Armor_set#List_of_armor_sets)
* [Weapon Sets filter table](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_weapon_sets#Weapon_sets_overview)
* [Stat changing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) Ascended armor/weapons is possible, but is somewhat costly (may be cheaper than crafting a new item, of course!)
  * _Remember!_ Do **not** stat change a _precursor_, it will be replaced with a generic item.

## Required reading

Your character's gear consists of following:

* 6 armor pieces + 1 _Superior Rune_ each
* 1-4 weapons + 1 _Superior Sigil_ each
* Trinkets
  * 1 Back item (not technically a trinket, but is grouped as such in Hero panel)
  * 2 Accessories
  * 2 Rings
  * 1 Amulet
  * 1 Relic

Some builds also list recommended _food and utility items_. Never leave home without them!

If you do Tier 2+ Fractals, _+9 Agony Infusion_ is **the** agony infusion type to get. All Ascended/Legendary gear has 1+ infusion slots (except Amulet and Relic).

Amulet has an _Enrichment Slot_, see [Enrichment @wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Enrichment). _Remember_, "+x% Gold from Monsters" is never worth it, they drop negligible gold.

Aquatic gear is:

* 1 Aquatic headgear + 1 _Superior Rune_
* 1-2 Weapons + 1 _Superior Sigil_ each

_Remember_, your active gear determines your stats. I.e. the weapon you hold in your hand is "active", the other one is ignored. Your headgear is ignored underwater and your Aquatic headgear is "active".

## Getting Exotic gear

Exotic gear can drop as loot from pretty much anywhere. Here's some deterministic ways to (repeatably) acquire **stat-selectable** exotic gear, which are not stupendously expensive. Also, achievement rewards and PvP/WvW reward tracks are also excluded.

From vendors:

| Vendor | Cost of 1 full set of armor | Notes |
|--------|-----------------------------|-------|
| TEID-07 (WvW) | {{< coins g=5 >}} + 400 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Badge of Honor" >}} | Badges of Honor {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Badge of Honor" >}} are Account Bound currency from WvW |
| Deft Lahar (Homestead) | 750 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Ursus Oblige" >}} + 1500 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Research Note" >}} | Ursus Oblige {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Ursus Oblige" >}} is JW currency. Research Note {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Research Note" >}} is "craftable currency" |

TEID-07 also sells Exotic weapons and trinkets.

Craftable options (recipes' costs are omitted):

| Set | Cost of 1 full set of armor | Notes |

| Titanplate | {{< coins g="~84" >}} [Crafting Calculator for Medium set](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~1!b~1!c~0!d~1-102247;1-103167;1-103055;1-102340;1-102609;1-102910!e~0) | |

| Warbeast | {{< coins g="~36" >}} [Crafting Calculator for Medium set](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~1!b~1!c~0!d~1-82859;1-82758;1-82773;1-83717;1-83392;1-82150!e~0) | Named variants are tradeable but a lot more expensive |




## Upgrading from Exotic?

If it has time for you to upgrade from Exotic to Ascended/Legendary, but you don't have the resources to upgrade _all_ gear, what to prioritize?

Considering stat increases, consult the following table (calculations done with **celestial** stats, see full table at the [source](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attribute_combinations#Attribute_bonuses_at_level_80)):

* Trinkets have the biggest increase
* Weapons are good
* Upgrade Chest first, then Head/Legs, and Shoulders/Gloves/Boots last 

Also, if you are upgrading to Legendary, you may want to consider the _utility_ of the items. Reflect on the following:

* The following are usable by _all_ your characters:
  * Legendary trinkets
  * Legendary runes
  * Legendary sigils
* Light/medium/heavy armor, which you use the most?
* Which weapon is _the coolest_ 😎
