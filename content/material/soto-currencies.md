So, you're crafting the legendary Obsidian armor. Sweet! But you need SotO map currencies and rift essences, specifically:

* {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Static Charge" true >}} ➡️ {{< inlineIcon "items" "Case of Captured Lightning" true >}}
* {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Pinch of Stardust" true >}} ➡️ {{< inlineIcon "items" "Pouch of Stardust" true >}}
* {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Calcified Gasp" true >}} ➡️ {{< inlineIcon "items" "Clot of Congealed Screams" true >}}
* {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" true >}}, {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" true >}}, {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" true >}} ➡️ {{< inlineIcon "items" "Amalgamated Rift Essence" true >}}

You need _a lot_, so let's focus on processes on how to accumulate them. First we discuss the target items that we need, then Rift Essences, then map currencies.

_Remember!_ This is legendary crafting we're talking about. It'll take time. See my general notes on legendary crafting (TODO).

There is a **TL;DR** version at the bottom of the page, which includes _my_ current process.

## Target items

You need one of each of the following for each armor piece. _Note!_ This is not a full Obsidian Armor crafting guide. Some crucial stuff is omitted, we focus on SotO/Rift currencies in this post. Here is a simple tree of the target items for one piece of armor:

* {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of Mighty Prosperity" true >}} or {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of Magical Prosperity" true >}}, depending on piece
* {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of Expertise" true >}}:
  * {{< inlineIcon "items" "Eldritch Scroll" true >}}
  * 50 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Obsidian Shard" true >}}
  * {{< inlineIcon "items" "Cube of Stabilized Dark Energy" true >}}
  * 12 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Amalgamated Rift Essence" true >}}:
    * 3000 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 1200 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, 600 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}} (or 250 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 100 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, 50 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}} each)
    * 600 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Glob of Ectoplasm" true >}}
* {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of Stormy Skies" true >}}:
  * 5 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Case of Captured Lightning" true >}}
  * 5 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Pouch of Stardust" trye >}}
  * 5 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Clot of Congealed Screams" true >}}
  * {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of the Astral Ward" true >}}:
    * Map completion gifts: 1 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of Skywatch Archipelago" true >}}, 1 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of Amnytas" true >}}, 1 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of Inner Nayos" true >}}
    * {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of Persistence" true >}}: 250 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Static Charge" >}}, 250 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Pinch of Stardust" >}}, 250 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Calcified Gasp" >}}, and 250 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Ancient Coin" true >}}


Here is [a link to GW2Efficiency's](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~0!c~0!d~1-100288;1-100852!e~0) crafting calculator with one {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of Expertise" true >}} and one {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of Stormy Skies" true >}}, using own materials. With this you can track how close you are to your next armor piece with regards to these gifts.

## Rift Essences

You can get rift essences by rift hunting and from convergences. That's it. The [wiki page on Rift Essence is good](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rift_essence). The math is spelled out here.

### Convergences

There are two Convergences in the game, one in SotO and one in JW. Both are pretty fun. Both have public instances every 3 hours, private squads can enter anytime. Completing one convergence takes 15-30 minutes, depending on the group.

Both of the convergences give good loot, but we only focus on rift essences. We assume you have to SotO mastery "Convergence Mastery".

Loot common to both convergences:

* _Repeatable achievements (transfer essence, beat enemies, etc.):_  {{< inlineIcon "items" "Nugget of Rift Essence" true >}}:
  * On average: 18 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 7 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, 3 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}}
* _Daily challenge mode reward:_ {{< inlineIcon "items" "Convergence Challenge Mode: Gold" true >}} (or silver, or copper)
  * Based on boss: 24-150 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 10-60 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, 5-30 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}}
* _3x weekly achievements: "Convergences: Inner Nayos", "Convergences: Mount Balrior", both yield in total:
  * 1 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Unstable Rift Motivation" true >}}
  * 3 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Convergence Extraction" true >}}
    * Each: 250 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 100 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, 50 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}}

Outer Nayos loot:

* _Once per day:_ {{< inlineIcon "items" "Convergence: Hero's Choice Chest" true >}}
  * Choose one of: 100 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 40 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, 20 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}}
* _Repeatable Map Meta-Event Rewards:_
  * Based on participation: 25-50 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 10-20 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, 5-10 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}}
  * "Rift Essence Extractor" buff (see Rift Hunting)

Mount Balrior loot:

* _Once per day:_ {{< inlineIcon "items" "Convergence: Mount Balrior Commander's Choice Chest" true >}}
  * Choose one of: 100 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 40 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, 20 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}}
* _Repeatable Map Meta-Event Rewards:_
  * Based on participation: 25-50 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 10-20 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, 5-10 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}}
  * "Rift Essence Extractor" buff (see Rift Hunting)


### Rift Hunting

Please see ["Rift Hunting" in Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rift_Hunting). We assume you have SotO mastery "Rift Mastery".

Weekly rift hunting rewards first.

Both SotO and JW have achievement category "Weekly Rift Hunting". SotO has 3 SotO maps and 3 rotating maps in prior expansion zones. JW always has the same 4 JW maps. This is a total of 10 weekly Rift Hunting maps (though fun varies!). Completing 5 rift hunts _of any tier_ in a map yields 6 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Rift Extraction" true >}}, each giving 5 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 5 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, and 2 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}} on average.

Repeatable rift hunting rewards next.

You don't need them, but you may be interested in Motivations. They can be crafted or bought from TP. See below how these are used!

| Motivation                                                   | Track rifts | TP Cost                     |
|:------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|----------------------------:|
| {{< inlineIcon "items" "Fine Rift Motivation" true >}}       | Tier 1      | {{< coins g=3 s=38 c=00 >}} |
| {{< inlineIcon "items" "Masterwork Rift Motivation" true >}} | Tier 2      | {{< coins g=3 s=99 c=77 >}} |
| {{< inlineIcon "items" "Rare Rift Motivation" true >}}       | Tier 3      | {{< coins g=4 s=80 c=72 >}} |

Before using the rift hunting action, you must choose which tier you're tracking. By default this is Tier 1. Double-clicking any motivation will change the tier. This does _not_ consume the motivation!

The difference between the tiers is how tough the enemies are, the location of the rifts, and the tier of rift essences rewarded (the _amount_ stays the same). Beating the rift's boss yields 6-14 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}} .Beating a rift's pre-event always yields 3-7 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, though.

Before (and during?) rift's boss, you can also put a motivation in the rift (_consuming_ it!) to yield _additional_ essence if the boss is defeated. If you have the convergence buff "Rift Essence Extractor", it's 30-50 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}} (and without the buff, only 17-32 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}}) (so maybe it's bet not to use motivations without the buff active, as the motivations are quite pricey). This bonus is _personal_, i.e. each player wanting this bonus has to put their own motivation into the rift (TODO: citation needed!).

_NOTE!_ Using motivations in Tier 1 is optional, but in Tier 2 and Tier 3 _someone_ has to use a motivation to lure out the boss.

How long does a rift take? TODO Some numbers here. But a lot of the time is also used traveling between rift locations. Please see the Rift Hunting wiki page for maps of all the maps' rift spawn locations. JW has good maps:

* _Mistburned Barrens_ has only two Tier 1 rift locations pretty close to each other (Beetle recommended)
* _Mistburned Barrens_ has only two Tier 2 rift locations pretty close to each other (Skyscale recommended, Warclaw should work)
* _Bava Nisos_ has only two Tier 3 rift locations (TODO But I haven't confirmed this personally)

### Trading Post?

Ok, you can buy rift essences from TP, but it is prohibitively expensive. Buying 1 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Rift Essence Coffer" true >}} (for {{< coins c=79 >}}) and 1 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Unstable Rift Motivation" true >}} (for {{< coins g=7 s=64 c=44 >}}). These combine into a {{< inlineIcon "items" "Unlocked Rift Essence Coffer" true >}} which according to Wiki's drop rate research drops 38 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}}, 15 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}}, and 7 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}} on average. You'd need to buy 100 of these to make one {{< inlineIcon "items" "Amalgamated Rift Essence" true >}}.

## SotO Map Currencies (and the associated rare crafting materials)

_Sidenote!_ You can get the crafting materials straight from SotO meta-events! Both Skywatch Arhcipelago's and Amnytas' meta-events occur every 2 hours, and Inner Nayos has 3 meta-events (as long as pre-events are progressed by players). Each of these yields _daily_ one rare crafting material related to that map.

How to get the map currencies.

### Magic Baubles

Each map has [Latent Magic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Latent_Magic) floating around, each gives 2-4 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Static Charge" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Pinch of Stardust" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Calcified Gasp" >}}. Gathering these are limited to 100 of the currency per map (or 300 in Inner Nayos) _per account_.

### Arcane Chests

Greater Arcane Chests reset daily _per account_. Lesser Arcane Chests reset on new map instance _per character_.

_Skywatch Archipelago_ and _Inner Nayos_ have many Greater Arcane Chests. I use (the name of the BlishHUD marker pack here) to gather them daily. _Amnytas_ has... three? And one of them is behind the event that requires 5 people. Not very farmable. I have one character parked at one of the greater chests, though. I can run Skywatch Archipelago's 10 Greater chests in less than 10 minutes, and Inner Nayos' 5 Greater chests in 3 minutes (Roller Beetle and Griffon help out a lot).

_Amnytas_ map closes after meta-event, so you can park multiple characters at Bastion of the Natural, and check on them every two hours. There's 4 possible spawn points for the chest, you'll soon get the hang of checking them places.

Greater Arcane Chests yield 4-18 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Static Charge" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Pinch of Stardust" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Calcified Gasp" >}}, Lesser Arcane Chests yield 2-10 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Static Charge" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Pinch of Stardust" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Calcified Gasp" >}}.

_Note!_ The chests contain a lot of other goodies as well! E.g. {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Ancient Coin" true >}} and rare gear.

### Events

All of the events give map currency. I don't have _any_ math for this, yet.

### Lantern Runs

_Sidenote!_ You have to do the lantern achievements for the the map gifts (or map completion, but it's a lot easier to do lantern runs). After you have all the map gifts for all the {{< inlineIcon "items" "Gift of the Astral Ward" true >}} you need, you can convert the rest into map currencies.

Hot tip for lantern runs! Things you can do while powering: be on your mount, dismount, move, use map. Things you _can't do_ while powering (will cancel): mount up, use any F thing (e.g. upraft generator), use waypoint. Once you practive a bit, you can really whiz by the lanterns on your mount 😄 The visuals are wierd at times, but you'll get a feel for it in a couple of runs, I'm sure!

It's easiest to do these if you follow an overlay path, and do one map in one sitting. Otherwise you'll have to keep track of which lanterns you've already done. And don't miss any, or prepare to cross-reference the achievement panel and the wiki for your missing lanterns 😉

_Gharr Leadclaw_ (or the {{< inlineIcon "items" "Portable Wizard's Tower Exchange" true >}} they sell) trades in a lot of stuff, including SotO currencies. You can convert map gifts into 200 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Static Charge" true >}}, 200 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Pinch of Stardust" true >}}, or 100 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Calcified Gasp" true >}}. I can do one lantern run in 10-20 minutes (Inner Nayos is the fastest), so this is _fine_ way of getting the map currencies. The problem is that _it's so boring_! 😅 There's no fighting, and the only rewards you get besides the gift are 1 transmutation charge and 1 exotic piece of gear.

### Gharr Leadclaw continued

Gharr does sell SotO map currencies for other stuff as well: Rift Essences. You trade in 35 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Masterwork Rift Essence" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Rare Rift Essence" >}} to get 10 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Static Charge" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Pinch of Stardust" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Calcified Gasp" >}}.

Let's calculate. With Tier 1 rifts, your essence rewards are: 3-7 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} for the pre-event, 6-14 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} for the boss, and 30-50 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} with motivation+buff (again, not using a motivation without a buff). Let's calculate without a moticvation, and let's say it's a total 15 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} per rift on average. Running between the _Mistburned Barrens's_ two Tier 1 rifts should be quick. (TODO I don't have data, but I guess) you can average 1 rift / 3 minutes 🤷‍♀️. So in the 15 minutes you'd do a lantern run, you can do 5 rift hunts, which yields 75 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} ➡️ 20 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Static Charge" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Pinch of Stardust" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Calcified Gasp" >}}. With tier 1 motivation + buff this increases to 275 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} ➡️ 70 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Static Charge" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Pinch of Stardust" >}} / {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Calcified Gasp" >}}

Not as lucrative as the lantern runs - when only looking at rift essence. But I give you 2 excellent counter-arguments: 1️⃣ Rifts and their mobs drop loot/xp, and 2️⃣ This is a lot more fun and can be done with friends (lantern runs are solitary activities).

## TL;DR

Doing both convergences 3 times a week yields enough rift essence for 6 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Amalgamated Rift Essence" true >}}. If you manage that, your  Obsidian Armor crafting has other bottlenecks, surely. You can squeeze a bit more out of them by doing each convergence max once per day, but don't stress that.

Weekly convergence rewards yield total of 2 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Unstable Rift Motivation" true >}}. I think if you're doing the convergences regularly, you can spare to insta-sell these for {{< coins g=6 s=00 c=49 >}} each.

Repeating convergences after those 3 weekly ones is fine. Maybe you're after the buff to use with your motivations?

The weekly rift hunting achievements net you nice amount of rift essences, too. I don't like doing Inner Nayos rift hunts, alone at least. JW's first to maps give out Heart tokens, as well, which is nice. Limitless rift hunting to farm essences may be fine, needs more calculation.

Look into Greater Arcane Chest routes. Maybe you're interested in Latent Magic routes as well. Maybe alt-park characters at Lesser Arcane Chests, at least in _Amnytas_. These will provide a slow but steady flow of map currencies for you.

Participate in SotO meta-events, max once per day per map. These will give the rare crafting materials to you, one per day.

Lantern Runs are boring, but efficient way of accumulating map currencies. I prefer Tier 1 Rift hunting and converting {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Fine Rift Essence" >}} into map currencies. I have mixed feelings on using {{< inlineIcon "items" "Fine Rift Motivation" true >}}, they do speed up considerably the essence gathering, but they're quite expensive.
