So you want legendary gear? Read up! I have done my best to keep things succinct.

## Preface

## What to craft first

If you are concerned about the stat increase from Exotic (though remember that Ascended and Legendary have the same level of stats), consult the following (information calculated from [this table in the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attribute_combinations#Attribute_bonuses_at_level_80), assuming celestial stats):

* Weapon:
    * 1h: +3 each
    * 2h: +5
* Armor:
    * Chest: +4
    * Legs: +2
    * Head: +2
    * Shoulders: +1
    * Gloves: +1
    * Boots: +1
* Trinkets
    * Amulet: +6
    * Ring: +15 each
    * Accessory: +15 each
    * Back item: +14

This data would have you believe that upgrading your trinkets first is the best idea. This might be, they have _huge_ utility since all your characters can use them regardless of profession and build. But consider also following. These numbers are a bit skewed, since they're calculated with Celestial stat line, which you're likely not using on Legendary at least. Also, e.g. the cost of buying each of your characters their own rings Vs the cost of buying them their own helmets are very different.

At the end of the day though, each and every Legendary has _a positive impact_ on your characters. Choose what seems cool to you. And once you craft your first legendary, the next one's a lot easier. It might be a good idea to focus on one at a time, though.

In this document we first explore Trinkets, then Armor, and finally Weapons.

## [Trinkets 💍](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_trinket)

Reminder: 1x Amulet, 2x Accessories, 2x Rings. Also, Visions of Eternity will add one accessory and one ring, so stay tuned.

There is only one Legendary amulet in the game: [Prismatic Champion's Regalia](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prismatic_Champion%27s_Regalia). You have to complete Seasons of the Dragons meta achievement, which has you complete challenges in Living World seasons 2, 3, 4 and 5. There is _no material cost_ nor crafting, you get it after completing all the achievements.

There are two accessories: [Aurora](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aurora) and [Vision](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vision). Aurora is from LWS3 and Vision is from LWS4. Both require you to complete a lot of achievements (which may have not-insignicant costs and time-gates), and finally the legendary itself has to be crafted.

Aurora's account bound materials: 

* 250 of each map LWS3 currency (e.g. 250 Fresh Winterberries)
* 1 Crystalline Ore (gathered from Noxious Pods, also sold by Gharr Leadclaw)
* 1 Bottle of Airship Oil, 1 Pile of Auric Dust, 1 Ley Line Spark
* 1 Obsidian Shard
* 200 Spirit Shard

* 77 Mystic Clover
* 1 Gift of Battle

There are two rings: [Coalescence](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Coalescence) and [Conflux](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Conflux). Coalesncence is from PoF Raids, and Conflux is from WvW. You can actually craft two Confluxes! Coalescence requires you to complete the Coalescence achievements.

* 5 Gift of Battle
* 1 Legendary Spike

## [Back Item 🎒](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_back_item)


| Type | Legendaries |

## Armor 🤺

TODO Here list the different Armors. I would like to compare the the costs in a easy way.

TODO Also! The Perfected Envoy armor set requires the ascended precursor. You get one set from the achievements, but you have to craft the rest! So, one plan is to do one set of Perfected Envoy, and another set of Obsidian, and another set of PvP. For example! (since Obsidian also has a bit of a different thing from the first vs 2nd+3rd).

## Weapons ⚔️
