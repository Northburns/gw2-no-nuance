##  My 34 Minute Passive Gold Routine That Keeps Me Rich (The Hero's Codex)

{{< youtube pyk94C2v8rc >}}

1️⃣ Alt-parked at Cantha HPs, {{< coins gg=3.3-5.3 >}}/day:

* _Seitung Province:_ Veteran Jade Bulwark (near `[&BP8MAAA=]`)
* _Seitung Province:_ Old Bell Shrine (south of `[&BGQNAAA=]`)
* _New Kaineng City:_ Engineer Hu (south of `[&BOUMAAA=]`)
* _New Kaineng City:_ Veteran Purist Necromancer (NE from `[&BNIMAAA=]`)
* _Arborstone:_ Tsuko Talonedge
* _Dragon's End:_ Peddler, buy 6 {{< inlineIcon "items" "Writ of Dragon's End" true >}} (1 for 1050 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Karma" >}}, 5 for other EoD Writs)

Consume the writs, you'll get 35 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Imperial Favor" true >}} / day. Once you hit 1000 {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Imperial Favor" >}} (29 days), craft EoD precursor weapon and sell it.

2️⃣ Echovald Chest Park, {{< coins gg=2.72-6.12 >}}/day

Hmm, griffin + position rewinder. I don't feel like describing the path, at this moment...

3️⃣ Bjora Marches {{< coins gg=6.9 >}}/day

3 characters parked at 3 Large Essence Chests. Uses position rewinder + griffin to grab more chests.

Convert the Eternal Ice to Tyrian Defense Seals. Ingots?

4️⃣ Smaller Parks

Mesmer parked at the honey jumping puzzle (40s/day).

SotO chest parks. Amnytas = Crystal Pool. Inner Nayos = 2 chests.

Drizzlewood Coast. Buy 5 Cache Keys.

5️⃣ Daily Harvesting & Homesteads

Guild Hall (multiple guild halls with different leves is possible). Homestead. Volatile glyphs in gathering tools is the money maker!

Craft {{< inlineIcon "items" "Grow Lamp" true >}} to sell.

LWS3+LWS4 materials create magic, which can be converted to money. (My note: but they can also be used to buy differernt ascended gear, be adviced)

6️⃣ Daily Crafting

{{< inlineIcon "items" "Lump of Mithrillium" true >}} to {{< inlineIcon "items" "Xunlai Electrum Ingot" true >}} to sell. 

Craft {{< inlineIcon "items" "Dragon Hatchling Doll Hide" true >}} to sell.

7️⃣ Weekly tasks

Arborstone, buy {{< inlineIcon "items" "Antique Summoning Stone" true >}} (don't buy the one that costs {{< inlineIcon "currencies" "Imperial Favor" true >}})

Wizard's Vault weeklies.

Provisioner Tokens (don't trade ectoplasms).
